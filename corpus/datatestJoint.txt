0 -_S Note for future me : Make sure you have enough free space before attempting to upgrade debian . 
1 *_I I think it's going to be OK , but a bit of manual jiggery-pokery has been required so far . 
2 *_I As long as you can still boot it's fixable . I had an Ubuntu upgrade blow up in spectacular fashion due to space issues but I was able to fix it with some very careful aptitude-fu . 
3 +_A Yeah it turned out fine , 
4 -_I but had to do a bit of apt-get - f install , remove / var / lib / apt / extended_states as it got corrupted , and a few reinstalls of selected packages .

0 -_I leaking negative energy 
1 +_I cofe gives full power to beat away the negative energy 
0 *_D probably not . 
1 +_I My laptop is now nice and runs smoothly . 
2 *_I Well I have another older laptop , but that wouldn't be in daily use . 
3 *_O What OS do you have installed on your laptop ? 
4 *_I I only have one machine , so I tend to break things once in a while . 🙂 
5 *_W I don't remember what's there . Might be Debian Jessie . I haven't started it in ages . 
6 -_I Besides it's lacking battery , so it's annoying to use . 
7 -_I My laptop is ancient and only works when plugged in energy too . 
8 *_O But what I meant was : what OS do you currently use on your main machine ? 
0 *_O who else ? 
1 *_I Practice is everything , theory is nothing in this case 😒 
2 -_D I see your point but I'm not completely sold on it ... 
3 *_I because it is not " right " . Still the state is one of the main contractor and seller of goods and services , besides all chickentalk of free market liberals . so theory counts more than an " ignore it right the way " adresses

0 *_I Mesh testing . It looks like on Stretch the wifi adaptors aren't detected . Investigating why . 
1 *_Q is there a good starting point for learning about mesh in Debian ? 
0 *_R Help help help 
1 +_I I like cuties taller than me but I also like to pick cuties up and carry them and the latter tends to be difficult when combined with the former just because of how unwieldy it would be . 
2 *_R surround yourself with multiple cuties ! 
3 +_A I find this an agreeable solution ! 
0 *_Q has grain retention been improved lately tho ? 
1 -_I It was pretty bad last time I watched HEVC content 
2 *_W dunno , but unless you crank up the bitrate really high , I doubt that it's possible to preserve it in the first place 
3 *_A yeah obviously more grain would necessitate a higher bitrate , but if you have to crank it up all the way to h264 levels then it's not really interesting x ) but I'm sure this will be fixed not too far down the line , if it isn't already 
0 -_I Painfull #debian upgrade : - No network ( interface names changed ); - Mysql database corrupted ; - Python 2 broken ( problem with python-openssl ) .

0 -_I The number 46 is not sticking in my mind . I have to spend many moments remembering that I am neither 36 nor 56 , and I'm not sure that my usual feud with the nature of time accounts for it entirely .

4 +_V and i hope you prosper in therapy ❤ ❤ 
0 *_I Just get Arch #ArchIsTheBest 
1 -_I It is . Until some update inevitably breaks everything . 
2 +_A sure but it usually fixes itself the next day or so 
0 -_I Painfull #debian upgrade : - No network ( interface names changed ); - Mysql database corrupted ; - Python 2 broken ( problem with python-openssl ) . 
1 -_A You are not the only one complaining about MySQL databases . It happened with a lot of people .

1 -_I i hate my life 
2 -_A lol sucks 
0 -_I Can't say I like that idea , it's just turning tooting into a competition for the most faves . 
1 *_I I mean you can support the project or something on liberapay if you have that euro a month to spare ... 
2 -_I A cent is just too worthless , even a super-successful toot isn't going to raise more than a euro or two . 
3 *_I if you made this a thing on Twitter , those X k tweets would be good business . ( And celebrities would cash in like crazy , if people actually bothered to prepay their accounts ) 
0 -_I GitHub has a UI that now gives you a demerit for not having a code of conductSince this is Mastodon I suppose I should be explicit about saying I think this is stupid 
1 *_I makes your repo ’ different since YYYY . 
0 *_Q Should we bring Tits out Tuesday ( #TT ) to masto ? 
1 *_W My squirrels are arguing with each other about this . I think anon [ 1 ] only hesitation is that I don't really have much to show ( yet [ 2 ] ) . She likes the idea , though . 1 . my Head Squirrel in Charge of Gender 2 . a hopeful insertion

3 *_A Yeah , I looked for it 
4 -_I but didnt find it ... 
0 *_O Is it me or it's not possible to make a text search in #mastodon ? <MENTION> 
1 *_W You can only search for users or #hashtags , as far as I know . Someone implemented a full text search tool a while ago , I think , but it was somewhat controversial ( mainly because of privacy concerns ) . 
2 -_D I dunno why privacy would be a concern - if people publish something public - it's public - weird ... 
0 *_I my wife got all 900 korok seeds yesterday . 
1 *_I what a nerd lol

0 *_I The longer I'm on Mastodon , the more the Fed timeline feels like the birbsite . Local timeline will be the killer feature . imho 
1 -_V I'm hoping for a lot of innovation here when it comes to timelines - looking forward to something distinctive coming up again . 
2 +_I But must say , I like being able to change across both . 
0 +_I Tiger & Bunny is such a weird take on the superhero idea and I love it . #anime 
1 +_A I really loved Tiger & Bunny because it did such different things ! 
2 +_I Didn't hurt that it was an excellent show on top of that as well ;) 
0 *_I everyone on mastodon is posting about suddenly waking up at 5am / earlier than they were supposed to .

6 -_I oh nodoing Anything is going to get incredibly difficult ... very overly copmlicated rules 
0 *_I for cereal though <MENTION> just sits on the project creation screen , then it gives 502what ever Dx i'll just keep writing stuff 
1 *_S host your own :p 
2 *_I if you know a cheap ( like $ 1 ) alternative or something I will poke at it . but rn DO is all I'd lean toward and even then $ 5 / mo adds up : c 
0 -_I The longer I'm on Mastodon , the more the Fed timeline feels like the birbsite . Local timeline will be the killer feature . imho

2 -_I I have tabs from months ago that I keep telling myself I'll get to ... I've been trying to use the Snooze Tab addon recently to keep the under control but I never seem to snooze them long enough ! 
3 -_I you're doomed . It may be time to declare bankruptcy .

0 *_O Is the English word for Rhabarber really " pie plant " or is my dictionary trolling me 
1 *_W never ever heard it called pie plant in the uk , just rhubarb . love that stuff . 
2 +_A yeah , it's great . ( It's a mild laxative though , so you shouldn't eat too much of it ) 
0 *_I Walked into a brainstorm . Production deadline for the job is Thursday.One of the creatives suggested building an app .

0 -_I My favorite kind of bug in PHP : the one that says 200 OK with no content and no logging of any error . 
1 *_I Assuming you mean it doing this on AndStatus or qvitter , it's the clients misinterpreting the status code as far as I can tell . There's never been genuine errors in the log when it occurs . 
2 *_I Work code . Probably an exception handler eating exceptions again .

2 *_R Name five prominent capitalists . " 
3 *_W that's too easy . Those scumbags are on screen of every zombie box . 
0 *_I I don't want to ruin the local buzz but I have some serious socially induced over stim . Normally gorging myself on fanfic would soothe the beast , but alas , I read it all . 
1 *_I My mechanism for that is following the favourited / followed stories of whomever I just read . 
2 +_I It's usually worth ... 
3 *_Q something ? 
4 *_Q you're into fandom ? 
5 *_O Which , if you don't mind me asking ? 
6 *_I I'm into football RPF at the moment , but I've had many love affairs with many fandoms .

0 -_I Since I didn't get in early on the mastodon.social instance , everyone I follow shows 0 followers ( in my instance , presumably ) . 1 ) it's weirding me out and 2 ) it's making it harder to find people to follow .

0 +_I im super into syntax btw and minimalism is ... intriguing 
1 +_I I'm semantics and pragmatics too ( mainly since I come at it via philosophy of language ) and also sociolinguistics ( esp gender-neutral language ) . Also some Japanese syntax . It's great to have more syntax folks here .

2 +_I Oh , this actually feels much better ! 
3 +_T Thanks for the tip ! 
4 -_I Anytime , the only really complaint that I have with twidere is a small one . Much of the terminology it is birdsite related.But I guess that helps with the adjustment to mastodon .
