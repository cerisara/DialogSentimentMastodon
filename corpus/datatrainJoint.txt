0 *_I So I wrote about Doom , and a part of its legacy that I feel a lot of old-school first-person shooters pass over . <URL> <URL> 
1 *_I deep in the nuances of the former human ( Zdoom decorate ) code recently , i was struck by how long the delay between their " aim " and " fire " frames are , 0.2857 seconds . i realized how much of my playing in hitscanner-heavy areas is about exploiting this window . 
2 +_I What a strangely specific value . I wonder how much tweaking went into it . 
3 *_I It's 10 tics ; tics in Doom are 1/35 of a second , an even 2X of 70Hz the vsync rate of the VGA mode Doom used . 
4 +_A Ah , that makes a lot more sense , 
5 +_T thank you . 
0 *_O why ? 
1 *_W Its a longf Story

1 *_Q green and yellow show up in redshifting , though , right ? 
2 -_I This isn't rotation - - it's shearing away from us , each vote travelling at a speed that either blueshifts to exactly this blue or red . What a strange phenomenon ... 
3 -_A Hmm ... I guess that does make more sense , 
4 -_I now that I look at it ... No WONDER he was kicked out ! His sciency analysis wasn't even correct ! 
5 -_I xkcd can be pretty funny sometimes , but I wonder if we're putting too much pressure on him to perform

3 +_A I love it ! It can get heavy and has some themes about abuse , though , so definitely a heads-up there . 
4 +_I Admittedly , those themes are why I like it so much , haha . I use it to deal with things . It's a really quality album . 
0 -_I So instead of the nice predictable wlan 0 and eth 0 we have some completely random device names . Thanks systemd .

1 *_S Could you wake at 4:35 and take a siesta after lunch ? Or maybe the Two Sleep system might work for you .

0 +_I I've mentioned this system before , but I can't get over how awesome the Holborn series lookedThis is the 6100 and 9120 ( pic with the lady ) and it's so Fallout ! 
1 *_Q Wasn't this also shown in the Soylent Green movie ? 
2 +_W Good eye ! But it was a floor standing computer , not a desktop 
3 +_J jeez , that was fast . 
4 +_I So possibly a set piece to look futuristic based on the desktop one . 
5 *_O Or do you somehow also happen to know that it was an actual computer ? 
6 +_I Ah , I was right ! It definitely was the arcade game . Here's more info on the exact model they redressed <URL> 
7 +_I that is wonderful . I love how they stuck a full TV in that cabinet instead of just the CRT 
8 +_I It's a pretty old trick , but considering the tech of the day , it was very cleverAlso , " modern " series were doing the same thingHere's a scene from StarTrek Voyager where you can clearly see the mouse cursor in the " LCARS " . Didn't know they still had mouse cursors in 2371 ;) 
9 +_A especially on a touch screen ,

1 +_I The last time I was at KSJC they'd given up all pretense of post -9/11 security and were keeping laptops in bags and waving folks through metal detectors with shoes on . It was wonderful . 
2 -_I this was not one of those times Nice airport tbh , just bummed that the airport bar is closed and my airplane is broken and I'm gonna sober up before they get a replacement aircraft in 
3 -_Q The plane is broken and the bar is closed ? 
4 -_I That's some Grade A bullshit right there . 
5 -_M Sorry fox .

1 -_I I'm very down ... I haven't read any good sci fi in awhile 
2 +_I if you don't want to wait AnonNomF AnonNomG writes great hard scifi . AnonNomF AnonNomG has good depictions of post-internet technology and AnonNomH AnonNomI helped me sort out plot points in my big fiction work

11 +_A in my case , yes , 
12 +_I all of it actually 
13 +_A I'm agreement with CP . Use of Weapons I liked more than Player of Games though . 
14 +_I I think I like mostly any of them where he reins in his desire to write hundreds of pages about things that are Very Big blowing up Very Spectacularly 
15 +_A yeah that's fair . 
16 +_I I think I'm more interested in explorations of the Culture than hard action

4 *_I I've seen that the midwest is even tighter with Trump than the South itself , 
5 *_Q that right ? 
6 *_A yes and they flaunt it . 
7 *_I It's because the midwest really isn't tied to any major cosmopolitan city except Chicago , Detroit and St . Louis . 
8 -_I Most of the midwest is rural and the rural population is uneducated redneck white folk . 
9 -_Q so they're still rocking with him ? after all that's happened since he took office ? 
10 -_A yes and on top of that , they refuse any factual evidence against him because their entire lineage are republican loyalists . 
11 *_Q aren't they doubting him though ? Like , he isn't your traditional republican . 
12 *_W not at all . Even though he isn't traditional , he still on the side of the GOP and to them , that's really all that matters . 
13 *_Q so GOP sympathizers in the MIdwest are some of those people who equate liberalism and Dems to the Left huh ? 
0 +_I I'm getting back into KSP career mode and it's a lot of fun , especially with more difficulty settings on ( like plasma blackouts and G-force limits ) .

4 *_I THEY LOOK SO SIMILAR im surprised its not the same artist but il check out both of them : O 
5 *_I AnonNameS is a little more Round , kinda organic in a way , while AnonNameT has sharper lines and shapes . if u look at them for a while u can start to notice the differences ! !

1 -_R Someone tell me how to feel !

2 -_O When will my fellow East Asians let anyone else at the media cake , honestly . 
3 -_I I get that we're still only getting a sliver of the whole thing , but it would still be better to also give literally any other Asian groups opportunities , too . 
4 -_A yeah it's like SO obvious too like i genuinely was trying to think of se / s asian actors in hollywood and u can really only think of the Big Names while there r a good # of east asians , i mean it's bad for all of us , but even more so for not east asians .

1 -_I my tolerance for awkwardness humor is low ( and not getting better ) ... I find " The Office " almost unwatchable 
2 -_A yeah . so awkward . it's very painful 
3 -_Q do people actually enjoy TV about , well , unpleasant people ? 
4 -_W I guess I do , sometimes , but seriously I get my fill of people being petty and vindictive in my daily life 
5 -_W See , the thing is that there are enough pleasant people that it strings you along ( for certain values of " you " ) 
6 -_A mheh , well said ! and you put your finger right on it , Jim and Pam are supposed to be those people for us , but after a while they just look insufferable too 
7 -_A yeah , I kind of stopped watching at some point when it was on because I couldn't deal with it anymore . 
8 -_O I mean , before Jim and Pam are together , you have that they really have to bone at some point . After they're together , why endure ?

0 -_O I really wonder why Beelzebub doesn't have 2nd season ? 
1 -_W nope sadly it doesn't , also anime stopped following manga after 49 episodes so rest 11 episodes are fillers , 
2 +_W but still it's one of my favourite delinquent based anime üòÜ üòÜ 
3 -_I that's why I felt confusion when I compare the manga to the Anime . I really wonder Why it was desperately forced to end that badly . üò≠ üò≠ üò≠ 
4 -_I I was to disappointed by watching the end , then someone said me anime didn't follow the manga so there's no chance of 2nd season . Damn I wonder why such things happen with amazing animes .. 
5 -_I when I read it in the net , most if there comments said that because the anime is more on violence that's why theres no chance of having a second season . I wonder why it only happens to beelzebub üò≠ üò≠ 
6 -_D nah that's not the reason , just think that anime doesn't follow the manga and adds it's own story and fillers , makes no sense , 
7 -_O so what do you think they'll show in 2nd season ? 
8 +_I and sadly I love this anime as it's the best delinquent based anime xD . 
9 -_A very well said ! In short , just made as dissapoint ! I really expect more towards this anime üò≠ üò≠

3 -_A true . 
4 *_I i'm just trying to find something that works Good Enough for my ( apparently niche and weird ) use case 
5 *_I AWS isn't about getting a single server online to do linuxy stuff . It's about large automated deployments of software and auto-scalling systems . The ability to spin up and down massive amounts of compute power at a whim . 
6 +_A yeah . 
7 -_I i don't have the budget to do anything like that , so not the place for me to be lookin ' . :/ 
8 -_A Yup . 
9 -_I And probably not all the time and patience it takes to write and maintain the kind of obnoxious software necessary to run such an environment . God knows I don't 
10 *_I if i could save money doing it and get experience in doing it for the future , i totallu would learn all that obnoxious stuff .

4 *_A oh , i see . yeah ... 
5 *_I the target market is enterprise customers it seems to me you pay a premium for all of the fancy cloud shit
