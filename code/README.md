# Building the corpus

The original corpus can be found within the files:

- datatrainJoint.txt : contains the anonymized text
- datatrainJoint.idx : contains the same text encoded with a lexicon
- datatestJoint.txt : contains the anonymized text
- datatestJoint.idx : contains the same text encoded with a lexicon

For cross-validation, datatrainJoint must be splitted with the script splitXval.sh

# Running experiments

Look into the script launch.sh
