# DialogSentimentMastodon
corpus and code for joint modeling of dialogue acts and sentiments in social media

The corpus comes from Mastodon and the training corpus has been manually anonymized.

The test corpus has still to be anonymized, but results from the paper may already be reproduced by using the datatestJoint.idx file, which only contains
word indices.
The corresponding datatestJoint.txt file with actual words will be released within a few weeks as soon as it is anonymized.
